# project-fa19
CS 170 Fall 2019 Project

This is the README for Andrew Kirillov and Ethan Mehta’s CS170 Project. Our team name is Giuseppe. Here are the instructions to run our project. 

Setup: 
You will need to have networkx, matplotlib, and numpy installed on your system. Clone this repository to access the codebase.

Running Information: 
We built the solver in the solve() function in solver.py (included in the project-fa19 starter). To run the solver, in the command line run “solve --all [input_folder] [output_folder]” where [input_folder] is the file path to a folder of valid inputs, as detailed in the project spec (linked here: https://cs170.org/assets/project/spec.pdf), and [output_folder] is the file path to the folder to which you would like the outputs written. 

Our solution is quite standard in its implementation, in that we do not use any commercial grade ILP solvers or anything that requires an installer. You should be able to pip install __ all modules that are required.
